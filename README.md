# Work-at-IITH
Software Engineer
Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer at the IIT Hyderabad (Research & Development) Department, where I have
gained substantial expertise in software development methodologies and have developed a strong
acumen for delivering efficient and scalable solutions. My primary project involves the GST (Goods
and Service Tax) initiative, where my responsibilities include:

Fraud Detection and Revenue Enhancement:
Utilizing Java Spring Boot and RESTful API design principles, I have developed and implemented
robust backend solutions for the GST application.
My work focuses on identifying fraudulent taxpayers and calculating their tax liabilities to enhance
government revenues.
Dashboard Management:
I am adept at creating and managing comprehensive dashboard reports that provide actionable data
insights for government officials and officers across states such as Tamil Nadu, Punjab, and Delhi. This
includes overseeing MIS (Management Information System) reports and daily operational
dashboards.
Complex Queries and Reporting:
I excel in crafting intricate PostgreSQL queries for data extraction and analysis, and possess strong
expertise in Excel for data manipulation and reporting.
